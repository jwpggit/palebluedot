                Our planet seems complicated, chaotic, and sometimes full of hatred. 
                When we look at our planet at a distance, it is a lonely, but precious speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. 
                Inspired by the astrophysicist Carl Sagan’s poetic philosophy, we pursue the simplification of complicated and convoluted things. 
                We cross boundaries through design, graphics, fashion, photography, video, music, architecture, and food. 
                We believe our work can mediate disputes, hatred, and misunderstanding on our planet.

            Our world focuses on big, luxurious, and beautiful things, but we view things from a different angle. 
            We start from tiny things and embrace the whole. This is the new balance we pursue. 
            When we think of our planet as a pale blue dot, we can realize the importance of humbleness, kindness, and the environment. 
            Likewise, we make people realize the preciousness of life via the simplification of complicated things.

            “Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us.” Carl Sagan said. 
            We hope we can make the world a better place. 
            If we can invoke people to feel the preciousness of the tiniest things and pure pleasure in our daily lives, 
            people may value YOUR pleasure as the same as MY pleasure.

            Balance and order do not come by themselves. 
            We can achieve them only when our philosophy has its own purpose and only when every design component serves its own purpose. 
            We pursue design with reason. We put meaning into every dot and every pixel of our work.
